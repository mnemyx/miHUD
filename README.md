## miHUD 
> A reworked [Shlaner's HUD](https://code.google.com/p/shlaner-hud/), which is [Shlaner's](http://youtube.com/shlaner) modification to [OMPhud](http://rawr.am/tf2hud/).
> 
> As of 6/19/2014, after the Love & War update, the HUD hasn't been updated since 6/1/2013. So this is an effort to try and get the HUD up-to-date while maintaining a similar style.

## Screenshots
> *coming soon*

## Installation
> Create a new folder to contain both *resources* and *scripts*, and place that new folder in: *...Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom*

## Customizations
> Any customizations listed on OMPHud's would probably work...but don't take my word for it.

## Updates

#### Version 0.1.0
> 1. Started repo, will slowly start making changes within the next few weeks to bring the HUD up-to-date
> 2. Existing modifications:
>	* 6v6 Scoreboards won't mess up when in MvM (need to test other scoreboards)
>	* Kill-streak layout (HudItemEffectMeter_KillStreak.res) from OMPHud
>	* Ping placement adjustment (it was cut off for me). Changed name_width to 104 in scoreboards
>	* *QuickplayDialog.res* and *QuickPlayBusyDialog.res* removed due to crashing. May be replaced in the future
>	* Removal of *ClassLoadoutPanel.res* due to missing Taunt options
>	* Removal of *ImportFileDialog.res*, *ImportFileTextDialog.res*, and *ImportPreviewItemPanel.res* as it broke TF2's Workshop Import screen
> 3. Known issues:
>	* Taunt menu 

## Questions/Issues
> Preferably, create a [new issue here](https://github.com/mnemyx/miHUD/issues/new). That way I can keep track of them, resolve them, and match commits to them.
