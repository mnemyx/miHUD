## miHUD 
> A reworked [Shlaner's HUD](https://code.google.com/p/shlaner-hud/), which is [Shlaner's](http://youtube.com/shlaner) modification to [OMPhud](http://rawr.am/tf2hud/).
> 
> As of 6/19/2014, after the Love & War update, the HUD hasn't been updated since 6/1/2013. So this is an effort to try and get the HUD up-to-date while maintaining a similar style.

## Screenshots
> *coming soon*

## Installation
> Create a new folder to contain both *resources* and *scripts*, and place that new folder in: *...Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom*

## Customizations
> Any customizations listed on OMPHud's would probably work...but don't take my word for it.

## Latest Update

#### Version 0.2.0, 6/19/2014
> Merged as much of the changes as I could find from all the updates since via OMP's GitHub. Need to tackle the updates afterwards to catch up to Love & War update.

## Questions/Issues
> Preferably, create a [new issue here](https://github.com/mnemyx/miHUD/issues/new). That way I can keep track of them, resolve them, and match commits to them.
