## miHUD 
	A reworked [Shlaner's HUD](https://code.google.com/p/shlaner-hud/), which is [Shlaner's](http://youtube.com/shlaner) modification to [OMPhud](http://rawr.am/tf2hud/).
	
	As of 6/19/2014, after the Love & War update, the HUD hasn't been updated since 6/1/2013. So this is an effort to try and get the HUD up-to-date while maintaining a similar style.

## Screenshots
	*coming soon*

## Installation
	Create a new folder to contain both *resources* and *scripts*, and place that new folder in: *...Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom*

## Customizations
	Any customizations listed on OMPHud's would probably work...but don't take my word for it.

## Updates

#### Version 0.1.0
	1. Started repo, will slowly start making changes within the next few weeks to bring the HUD up-to-date

## Questions/Issues
	Preferably, create a [new issue here](https://github.com/mnemyx/miHUD/issues/new). That way I can keep track of them, resolve them, and match commits to them.
